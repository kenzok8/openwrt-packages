### FYI

alpha os is my idea which wants to develop the OpenWrt community in Indonesia, even the world, thanks to friends who have supported this alpha-os theme, hopefully given health to all of us.


(old text) Mr. Sibondt once they said 'jalan ditempat komunitas indo', that's what moved my heart to make an innovation that I named alpha os (alpha = initial version, because it hasn't been perfect until now 😁)
